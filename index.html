        <h3>Build a website for a retail shop June2023.</h3>
        <p>
            I participated in the creation of a customer-friendly and competent website for a 
            retail shop, utilizing tools such as HTML, Java, JavaScript, and CSS. My duties included
             developing backend functionality with JavaScript, writing code and scripts for
              various website functionalities, and creating a responsive web design using CSS 
              across multiple pages. I structured webpages with HTML and implemented a 
              DOM framework for dynamic page interactions. I designed user-friendly web pages for
               customer registration and account creation, integrated features for online
                account and transaction detail retrieval, and ensured seamless customer interaction 
                throughout the website. The outcome was a responsive online retail system that enabled 
                customers to log in to their accounts and utilize all features effectively. The 
                project was successfully submitted and received a High Distinction.
